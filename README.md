# setting-up
initial set-up guidance

## Everyone

### Install Slack

Do not use the browser-based interface for Slack. Download and use the client. Let us know if you did not get an invitation to the Nashville Software School Slack organization, and we'll send you one immediately.

### Create a Github account

Github is the primary site that software developers throughout the world use to store their code, and share it with other developers. Visit the [sign up page](https://github.com/join) and create your own, free account.

### Install Python

We will be using __Python 3.6.3__ in the course. You can get it [here] (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Anaconda

We will be using __Anaconda 5.0.0__ in the course. Anaconda gives you Jupyter and the conda package manager. Be sure you get the version to match the Python version. You'll find it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).


## For Windows Users Only

Visit the [Git downloads](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) to get git for powershell.
